Libragen (pronounced "LIB-ruh-jen") lets you create portable, searchable RAG libraries from any documentation. Libraries are single SQLite files you can share, version control, and query locally—no cloud services required.

> **Try it now:** This documentation is available as a libragen library. Download <LibraryDownloadLink /> and query it locally!

## Quick Start

### 1. Build a Library

Create a library from a directory of markdown, text, or HTML files:

```bash
libragen build ./my-docs --name my-library
```

This will:
- Process all supported files in `./my-docs`
- Generate embeddings using a local model
- Build a full-text search index
- Save everything to `my-library-1.0.0.libragen`

### 2. Query Your Library

Search with natural language:

```bash
libragen query --library my-library "How do I authenticate?"
```

Results include relevance scores and source file information.

### 3. Use with MCP (Optional)

Install the MCP server for your AI tool with one command:

```bash
npx -y install-mcp @libragen/mcp
```

This automatically configures Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or other MCP-compatible tools. Your AI assistant can now query your libraries directly.

## Installation Options

### Use Without Installing

The easiest way to use libragen is with `npx`:

```bash
# Build
libragen build ./docs --name my-docs

# Query
libragen query --library my-docs "your question"
```

### Global Installation

For frequent use, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @libragen/cli

# Now use without npx
libragen build ./docs --name my-docs
libragen query --library my-docs "your question"
```

**Enable shell completions** for tab-completion of commands and options:

```bash
libragen completions install
```

### As a Project Dependency

For programmatic use in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-exact @libragen/core
```

## Library Storage

Libraries are discovered from multiple locations:

### Default Behavior

1. **Project directory** — If `.libragen/libraries/` exists in the current directory, it's included automatically
2. **Global directory** — Platform-specific location (see below)

| Platform | Global Path |
|----------|-------------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/libragen/libraries/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/libragen/libraries/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\libragen\libraries\` |

Project-local libraries take priority over global libraries with the same name.

### Project-Local Libraries

To use project-specific libraries, create a `.libragen/libraries/` directory in your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .libragen/libraries
libragen install ./my-lib.libragen -p .libragen/libraries
```

This is useful for:
- Project-specific documentation
- Version-controlled library sets
- CI/CD environments

### Environment Variables

Override the global directory with `LIBRAGEN_HOME`:

```bash
export LIBRAGEN_HOME=/custom/path
```

Run `libragen config` to see current paths and active environment variables.
